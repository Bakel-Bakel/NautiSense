# 🚢 NautiSense

[*NautiSense*](https://github.com/Bakel-Bakel/NautiSense/wiki) (short for **“Nautical Sense”**) is a project aimed at developing a **smart real-time ship motion monitoring system**.

---

### 🧭 Overview

In essence, NautiSense is designed to continuously **measure and analyze a vessel’s motions** and the **forces acting on it due to waves**. The system tracks multiple degrees of freedom in a ship’s movement, including:

- ⚓ **Heave** — vertical motion
- 🔄 **Roll** — side-to-side tilt
- ↔️ **Pitch** — fore-and-aft tilt
- 🌊 **Wave Loading** — external wave forces on the hull

---

### 🎯 Purpose

By capturing this data **in real time**, NautiSense addresses the need for:

- ✅ Improved situational awareness
- ✅ Enhanced maritime safety
- ✅ Remote accessibility to motion data
- ✅ High-fidelity insight into sea conditions and vessel behavior

---

### ⚠️ Problem It Solves

Ship operators often lack:

- Reliable, **real-time data** on how their vessel is moving
- Insight into **wave impacts** and dynamic responses
- **Remote access** to motion telemetry for decision making

---

### ✅ Key Benefits

- 🧠 Provides real-time motion feedback to **aid decision-making**
- ⚠️ Alerts mariners to **dangerous motion conditions**
- ⚙️ Helps adjust course/speed during heavy seas
- 📊 Enables **data logging** for:
  - Performance analysis
  - Simulation validation
  - Design evaluation

---

### 👨‍🔬 Use Cases

- For **mariners** to ensure safer navigation
- For **researchers** and **engineers** to validate marine design performance in diverse sea conditions

---

> **NautiSense** bridges the gap between embedded marine sensing, live visualization, and decentralized secure logging.
